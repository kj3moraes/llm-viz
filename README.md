# llm-viz

Experiments in visualization carried out on multiple LLMs. The following experiments were carried out 
- `conv` - exploring the relationship between convolutional neural networks and mutlihead attention
- `attention-maps` - exploring how attention is paid across different text and tokens between Mixtral and GPT2
- `experts` - exploring what each of the experts learned and what they might be specialized in. 

## Setup

I highly recommend using Poetry for this. To setup, just run 

```bash
poetry shell
poetry install
```
